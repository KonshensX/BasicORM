NOTES ABOUT TJIS SO CALLED LIBRARY 
-ITable Interface :
	- Fields :
		* ID
		* TableName
	- Methods :
		* Save(ITable object)
		* IEnumerable<ITable> GetAll()
		* ITable Get(int ID)
		* int Update(ITable object)
		* int Remove(ITable object)

	- Each table has an ID and a name
	- There should be a class the implements the ITable interface and all the other table gonna inherite directly from the Table Class


-Methods :
	- Get method
		* Each class has a get method which is inhereted from the Table class
		* How does the function know which class it should return
		* I cannot return the interface ITable because it cannot be used as variable (ITable is a type)

	- GetAll method
		* I need an instance of the object im trying to return so i can add it or yield it to a IEnumerable.
		* I need to iterate through the properties of the object im trying to return so that i can fill the values in before yeilding it to the IEnumerable.
